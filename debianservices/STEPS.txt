Unit Files Use .INI format using Section Headers in square brackets[] and Variable Declaration under the sections

Usual Unit File Location: 
/etc/systemd/system/
/lib/systemd/system/

Things to identify before creating a service:
	Name of the service should not match any existing service names
	Type,
	whether systemd to restart our service on exit,
	Environment Setup
	Service Dependencies like what services to be started before our service

Service Types:
	simple - Program runs in foreground
	forking - Use this if we can't prevent daemon from forking
	oneshot
	dbus
	notify or 
	idle

Environment setup

STEPS:
1. Create/Modify Unit file
2. Making systemd to look for new things: 
	systemctl daemon-reload
3. If we want the service to start everytime system is booted:
	systemctl enable myservice.service
OR
   Start as and when we want it to be
	systemctl start myservice.service
